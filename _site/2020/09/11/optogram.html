<p><img src="/thumbnails/me.jpg" class="smaller" /><em>Here, I‚Äôm taking a non invasive, low cost test to analyze my retinal health. I don‚Äôt have much media for this project as a lot of it is protected.</em></p>

<h4 id="the-test">The test</h4>
<p>The VEP, or Visual Evoked Potential, is a test that measures the an electrical response to a stimuli. It uses two electrodes that pick up a signal that is very strongly influenced by the retina and the optic nerve. With my background in neuroscience, I‚Äôm used to EEG machines that can have up to 64 electrodes, and often use computational techniques to subtract out the variance in signal due to the eye. By contrast, this test is much simpler and quicker to run, and relies on the eye to get a very strong and consistent reading.</p>

<h4 id="the-goal">The goal</h4>
<p>Typically, the results of this test are used for glaucoma diagnosis, but a body of research suggests that this data could give us more insight into the function of the nervous system, as the optic nerve is one of the thickest in the body. The test is relatively low cost and non-invasive, meaning if there is way to get insight into someone‚Äôs neurological health, we could potentially have a paradigm shift in screening for neurological disease.</p>

<p>My collaborator, a retinal specialist, has a long history of using this test on patients. With this dataset, we are able to draw correlations between Alzheimer‚Äôs related diagnosis and other issues with neurological health such as a B12 deficiency.</p>

<p>Working with a biomedical device maker, a computer scientist, and opthalmologists, I‚Äôm in the process of using deep learning algorithms to gain some insight on whether this test could be a way to detect neurodegenerative disease earlier. If we can see traces of this disease earlier, we can have a better chance at effective treatment. We are currently in the process of fundraising through NIH grants and biomedical investors.</p>
