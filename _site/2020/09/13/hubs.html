<p><img src="/images/hubs/hubs-resed.png" alt="hubs-resed" /><em>Pictured: Prof. Phil Ethington (redcoat), Prof. Amber Bennett (fox), me (mozilla shirt), Dr. Curtis Fletcher (3D replication of himself) ,and undergraduate students in mostly Halloween themed avatars as part of a Residential Education gathering</em></p>

<p>We managed to put a 1:1 replica of the <a href="https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab">Ahmanson Lab</a> in VR using <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com">Mozilla Hubs</a>. Since then we‚Äôve held office hours, meetings, workshops, and official gatherings in virtual space. <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/8Q9JRCZ">check it out here!</a> Here‚Äôs the story of how it happened:</p>

<p>Two years ago, my boss, the director of the Ahmanson Lab, Curtis, made a perfect 1:1 scale model of our lab in SketchUp, replete with furniture models from the manufacturer, 3D printing lab, and signage according to USC‚Äôs stringent style guidelines. It was a weird Inception feeling to put on a headset from our VR room and the <em>spawn</em> in an uncanny valley version of the VR room. Because our VR gear lived in the tech lab, and the labor associated with putting it in a networked app like <a href="https://hello.vrchat.com">VRChat</a>, it was an experience we could only exhibit to visitors‚Ä¶. until‚Ä¶..</p>

<p>Mozilla dropped Hubs, a cross platform video conferencing virtual room hosting service FOR FREE.</p>

<p>that was a lot of post-COVID buzzwords, but basically it allows users on devices from mobile to VR headset to join and navigate a 3D virtual room, manipulate objects, and do video/audio conferencing. It has a neat feature of doing spatial audio, meaning, the further you are from someone, the quieter it gets, enabling disparate groups to have conversations in the same lobby.</p>

<p>We decided to drop our lab into VR using spoke and it kinda sorta worked. The first few iterations were quite glitchy, and we were spawning on top of the model or breaking the colliders. It also had a size issue, because in order for Mozilla to do its magic, the asset sizes need to be lightweight and easy to render. I also spent a lot of time following the dev [community on Discord])(https://hubs.mozilla.com/discord) for tips.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-a-scene-for-vr">Preparing a scene for VR</h2>

<p>To build and design a scene for this platform, Mozilla built a tool called <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke">Mozilla Spoke</a>. It imposes some constraints on the performance footprint of the 3D environment. The biggest barrier has been the polycount. Much of the development time for me was researching ways to reduce the polycount and keeping compatibility.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hubs/hubs-decimate.gif" alt="hubs-decimate" /><em>Using Blender‚Äôs decimate tool on a model of my desk</em></p>

<p>After making a spreadsheet to compare different ways of reducing asset poly count and filesize, the Blender tool <em>decimate</em> and exporting to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gltb</code> format was optimum, shaving off about 10K polys or 30% for my test case. The amount of decimation varies, as the gif shows, too much decimation destroys the model. Every model was carefully altered as to reduce the polycount as much as possible but still retain form. The original, unmodified environment, which was simply inserting the Sketchup model of the lab was 370K polys and 81MB. After individually decimating each model, I was able to reduce the poly count to 295K with a filesize of 69MB. Still much higher that optimum but this reduction allowed us to components that would allow us to dock slides, and have effective breakout rooms.</p>

<p>During the first iterations of the lab, we used this virtual space in lieu of zoom for meetings. When this proved promising, we started to work on removing the glitches and polishing the experience so we could hold more formal gatherings and integrate it with other programming.</p>

<p>As part of the workshop series I run at the Lab, I decided to teach how to use Mozilla Spoke, as well as preparing 3D models for VR, and considerations for designing a virtual space. The interface of Mozilla Spoke is very similar to Unity and Unreal, so <em>while I was teaching the workshop</em> students had already created their own spaces and packed them full of memes and browser-breaking particle effects. (You may notice part of Spongebob in the above picture)</p>

<p>The next big demo of the technology was presenting to a group of new USC students in the Residential Education program. Every year, we meet some new USC students, showcase our technology, and invite them to participate in our makerspace. Since we couldn‚Äôt meet in person, we decided to meet in something more fun than Zoom. It went well, except that out-of-the-box, Mozilla Hubs has very little moderation. Since the slides in VR were an object, students would (either intentionally or unintentionally) throw it into oblivion or resize it while I was speaking. (probably intentionally) Students would also use the draw tool to graffiti everything and spawn random objects. Even though this chaos obscured the presentation, I was really pleased to facilitate a sense of play with WebXR, because one of my primary goals as an educator is to stoke natural curiosity.</p>

<p>Looking forward, we still use this space for virtual gatherings and lab hours. However, there is still optimization to be done in order to add more features. I‚Äôm thinking of integrating this with 3D modeling workshops as it‚Äôs a relatively painless way to exhibit and interact with work. It‚Äôs a good twist on conferencing that I recommend if you and your team is experiencing Zoom fatigue.</p>
