        <h3>Deep learning on retinal biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's and other neurodegeneration</h3>
        <p>Working with a biomedical device maker, a computer scientist, and opthalmologists, I'm in the process of using deep learning algorithms to gain some insight on whether this test could be a way to detect neurodegenerative disease earlier. If we can see traces of this disease earlier, we can have a better chance at effective treatment. We are currently in the process of fundraising through NIH grants and biomedical investors.</p>

        <h3>The Vatican and Mars Colonies in VR: Experimental pedagogies and research exhibition
</h3>
        <p>In Terraforming Mars, we worked with physics and creative writing professors, students, and space industry professionals to research terraforming techniques and create a virtual Mars colony to exhibit this content. In our Virtual Renaissance Library project, we worked with the Vatican, USC Libraries' Special Collections, art historians, and students to create a replication of the Raphael Rooms annotated with 16th century texts. Both of these were experiments in methods to lower the barriers to VR development and engage many types of people in the building process.</p>
