        <h4>hey! you found the website of Samir Ghosh</h4>
            <p>Currently, I’m teaching workshops, directing lab projects, and creating educational programming for the <a>Ahmanson Lab</a>, an interdisciplinary makerspace at USC that encourages students and professors to think critically about technology. We offer access to a 3D printer, an OpenBCI EEG machine, microcontroller kits, a drone, and VR dev resources. I help professors and students use these technologies to tackle interesting problems, such as Mars terraforming experiments or creating an EEG based brain computer interface. There's always something cool going on here.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computational Linguistics. Previously, I've interned at Intel where I worked to maintain massive server farms. In my free time, I take on all sorts of projects and consulting gigs such as coding wearable tech for internationally exhibited fashion pieces, and helping medical researchers create better ways of detecting neurodegenerative disease.</p>
            <p>When I'm not having fun working, I hang out with my two adopted kitties, do yoga, and swim in the Pacific.</p>
