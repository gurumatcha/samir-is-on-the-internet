My administrative effort to allocate resources to highly motivated students to tackle projects that use new technologies or examine new phenomena. On the technical side, students have used deep learning for FPGA design and audio synthesis. On a critical side, students have established think tanks on internet memes and streaming influence. It brings about 50 highly skilled and driven students to the lab every semester and establishes resources and techniques for the broader USC community.
