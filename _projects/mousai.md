After establishing an open EEG lab on campus for neuroscience research and BCI efforts, a group led by [Garrett Flynn](http://garrettflynn.com) won a Visions and Voices grant to exhibit generative art based on brainwave data and hold a panel to discuss bioethics issues surrounding neuroprosthetics, presented under a speculative fiction company called [Mousai Neurotechnologies](https://mousaineuro.com).  In lieu of an in-person event, we are building software infrastructure to livestream braindata and perform live analysis and generative art. Uses new techniques in WebGL and supported by an open OpenBCI sponsorship and USC Viterbi faculty. Event and software release in April 2021.
