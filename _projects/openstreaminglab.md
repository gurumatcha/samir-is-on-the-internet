After setting up an streaming lab infrastructure with VR and podcasting capabilities with the now famous [Eret](https://www.twitch.tv/theeret),  we created a massive Discord community and Twitch team of collegiate streamers that share a viewership of over 500k viewers. This community works with [Prof. Gordon Bellamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bellamy) who has made a class about streaming that empowers the next generation of influencers.
