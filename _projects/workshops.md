[Polymathic Making Workshops](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab/polymathic-making-workshops/polymathic-making-workshops-fall-2019) are a series I run every semester at the Ahmanson Lab that range from introductory topics in 3D printing or generative art, to advanced topics such as deepfakes and AR development. All of these workshops aim to teach a practical skill as well as critical issues in the technology's history and current influence.
