Collaborative effort with biomedical device makers, opthalmologists, and computer scientists to perform deep learning on retinal biomarkers for neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's and B12 deficiencies. I contribute data processing and I am experimenting with commercially implementable deep learning models. In the process of fundraising through biomedical investors and NIH grants.
