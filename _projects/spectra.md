Based on independent research in voice synthesis and phonetics from my undergraduate training, I am working with [Leo Dastur](https://github.com/TheInnerParty) to make a tool that automatically performs Daubert standard compliant phonetic analysis, and links to commonly cited papers in-browser. It uses recently available technologies in Web Audio and WebGL to provide computational analysis that previously needed very bespoke software and training.
