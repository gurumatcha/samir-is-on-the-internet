In lieu of hardware based programming, the Ahmanson Lab's Fall 2020 workshops were paired with a competition where the winner would get their design printed on a sticker and participants would receive this sticker as a token for participation. Topics included [Mozilla hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com), [Hydra Editor](https://github.com/ojack/hydra), [p5](https://p5js.org), and [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org).
