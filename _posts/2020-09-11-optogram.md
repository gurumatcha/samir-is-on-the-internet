desc: Working with an opthalmologist, a biomedical device maker, and a computer scientist, I am working to create a cheaper test to detect Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disease. By using deep learning techniques on non-invasive scans of the retina, we hope catch these pathologies earlier so treatment is more effective. My effort draws on my AI experience as a computational linguist, and visualization techniques from my work in media arts.

# To make a better test for Alzheimer's
<img src="/thumbnails/me.jpg" class="smaller">*Here, I'm taking a non invasive, low cost test to analyze my retinal health. I don't have much media for this project as a lot of it is protected.*

#### The test
The VEP, or Visual Evoked Potential, is a test that measures the an electrical response to a stimuli. It uses two electrodes that pick up a signal that is very strongly influenced by the retina and the optic nerve. With my background in neuroscience, I'm used to EEG machines that can have up to 64 electrodes, and often use computational techniques to subtract out the variance in signal due to the eye. By contrast, this test is much simpler and quicker to run, and relies on the eye to get a very strong and consistent reading. 


#### The hope
Typically, the results of this test are used for glaucoma diagnosis, but a body of research suggests that this data could give us more insight into the function of the nervous system, as the optic nerve is one of the thickest in the body. The test is relatively low cost, and non-invasive, meaning if there is way to get insight into someone's neurological health, we could potentially have a paradigm shift in screening for neurological disease. 

My collaborator, a retinal specialist, has a long history of using this test on patients. With this dataset, we are able to draw correlations between Alzheimer's realted diagnosis, as well as other issues with neurological health such as a B12 deficiency. 

Working with a biomedical device maker, a computer scientist, and opthalmologists, I'm in the process of use deep learning algorithms to gain some insight on whether this test could be a way to detect neurodegenerative disease earlier. If we can see traces of this disease earlier, we can have a better chance at effective treatment. We are currently in the process of fundraising through the pursuit of NIH grants and biomedical investors.
