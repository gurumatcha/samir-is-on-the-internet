# Building a brain-computer interface development resource


In 2019, a big investment of lab resources into setting up an OpenBCI machine helped the Ahmanson Lab build a space to support neuroscience research and brain-computer interface projects on campus. Led by [Garrett Flynn](https://github.com/GarrettMFlynn), we've gathered undergraduate and graduate students to develop integrations for this machine with Unity and Processing to take some of these advanced neuroscience techniques into other technical spaces. Some of this work has allowed us to control a car in a virtual environment with our mind, or to push the data into generative art projects. This has led to further opportunities and the acquisition of a grant to continue this work.

Following last year's success, with the help of professors from various schools, Garrett applied for and won a grant to make an immersive experience and academic panel on the topic of bioethics and brain computer interfaces. In light of remote campus, we pivoted the immersive experience to building a streaming platform that allows live streaming of EEG data and informative and beautiful generative art that helps elucidate the data. This is currently in development, and we're iterating on WebGL tools for the visualization and various server-client architecture to make sure these BCI devices run smoothly.
