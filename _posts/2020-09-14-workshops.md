# Polymathic Making Workshops
Every academic semester, I teach a workshop series spanning topics in 3D printing, VR/AR dev, hardware hacking, and creative code. [Check out Spring 2020's lineup as a sample](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab/polymathic-making-workshops/polymathic-making-workshops-spring-2020)

## Practical
<!-- ![pi](/images/workshops/pi.jpg)*In my Raspberry Pi workshop, I sneak in some practical tips for navigating a terminal and affordances of alternative OSs that integrate with engineering curricula* -->

These workshops students of various technical levels and academic backgrounds, so they are designed to be engaging for both newcomers and veterans. I have a belief that with proper planning, I can create content that teaches everyone something new, provides hands-on experience, and sparks critical discussion. 

These workshops aim to be hands-on and to teach the skills quickly so the participant can spend a majority of the workshop working independently and creatively. This often means teaching external skills to the topic such as how to debug or to learn from someone else's open source code. A part of practicality is also being prepared for students who already have experience, so I prepare advanced or contemporary techniques in case we blitz through the workshop faster than expected.


## Critical

I teach all of these workshops in the context of the technology's recent history, and role in commercial products. In this way, I hope to build appreciation and criticality to the tools a teach, as well as cue a participant on how this can be helpful for pursuing a career, as many of these students are seeking internships.


I've been strongly influenced by activists, scholars, and open-source contributors, so I'm quite passionate about political, economic, and ethical issues in technology. Once a semester, I do a workshop that first presents historical events surrounding surveillance capitalism. If I had to pick just three books that have shaped this content the most, it would be [*Habeas Data*](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/habeas-data/) by Cyrus Farivar, [*Twitter and Tear Gas*](https://www.twitterandteargas.org/) by Zeynep Tufecki, [The Darkening Web](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318518/the-darkening-web-by-alexander-klimburg/) by Alexander Klimburg, and [*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism*](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/) by Shoshana Zuboff. The second part of the workshop are discussions on these issues. One of the benefits of teaching at a university is that you get to hear from students around the world, who have very different experiences with their technology as far as government control and economic landscape.

## Equity minded
![3dprinting](/images/workshops/3dprinting.jpg)*My first workshop! I used an in-browser CAD tool to teach the basics of 3D printing. Participants could pick up what they designed a week later*

In an educational setting, it's important to me that every participant can access these tools, regardless of what kind of computer they bring in. On a university campus, not every one has a powerful laptop, and I learned this in a painful way when I held a VR dev workshop and half of the participants could not run the required game engine.

Fostering a welcoming educational environment and keeping equity in mind has many dimensions, but I know one way I can facilitate this is by teaching with tools that remove computational barriers to access. It has the added benefit of being quicker to use, and with good curricular design, there is no expense to technical caliber.

![p5](/images/workshops/improve.jpg)*My workshops improve over time as I learn new ways to teach. My favorite workshops to teach are on computational form and generative art, and I use p5.js's [in-browser editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) because it's incredibly easy to start coding*

## Migrating Workshops for Remote Learning
Campus closure due to the pandemic meant that a lot of these workshops had to be conducted over Zoom. The environment of the campus community changed a lot, so it took a trial and error period before I could bring students in at the same frequency. I believe teaching over zoom necessitates a faster pace, frequent check-ins for comprehension, and extra effort to make sure people feel connected.

![hubs-coca](/images/hubs/hubs-coca.png)*This workshops on designing VR spaces was probably the first Zoom lecture I got 'right' as it provided plenty of ways a participant could play with the tools while I lectured This is a VR selfie in Mozilla Hubs*

Perfecting Zoom curricula is an ongoing process to me, and current challenges include figuring out how I can teach principles that usually rely on microcontrollers or VR headsets.
