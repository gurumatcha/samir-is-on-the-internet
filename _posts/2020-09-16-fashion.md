# Coding wearable technology for a fashion designer

As a coder assistant, I worked with Behnaz Farahi to produce generative art and the wearable system for this piece, Bodyscape, and to help with maintenance code on a variety of other pieces. I worked on Arduino code that integrated accelerometer, EMG data, and eye-tracking cameras with pneumatic systems and lights. I also did Bluetooth, safety engineering, and preparations for both exhibitions on models and standalone. Check out the piece on [Behnaz Farahi's website](http://behnazfarahi.com/bodyscape/)
