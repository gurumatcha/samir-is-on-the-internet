  The Vatican and Mars Colonies in VR: Experimental pedagogies and research exhibition
type: project

desc: In Terraforming Mars, we worked with professors from Physics and Creative Writing, students, and people from the space industry to research terraforming techniques and create a virtual Mars colony to exhibit this content. In our Virtual Renaissance Library project, we worked with the Vatican, USC Libraries' Special Collections, art historians, and students to create a replication of the Raphael Rooms annotated with 16th century texts. Both of these were experiments in methods to lower the barriers to VR development and engage many types of people in the building process.

# Two projects to remove barriers to VR development in academia

The Ahmanson Lab has an ongoing project of prototyping VR for new curricula with professors. In 2018, in our Terrafrorming Mars VR project, we made it easy for students display research in VR. In 2019, we worked with art historians, the USC Libraries' Special Collections and The Vatican to annotate the Raphael Rooms with a16th century text.

This VR experience was part of a broader collaboration between scientists and professors to aggregate research about terraforming methods and put it in an engaging interactive Mars environment with models of habitation buildings. We used [a Unity plugin called Stepwork](http://step.works/) so students could add content to slides while Unity development happened concurrently.

## Stanza del Segnatura

The 16th century art historian Vasari wrote texts that are staple of critical analysis of Renaissance paintings. His text on the Raphael Rooms was novel because it is an early example of formal analysis of juxtaposed work. As his narrative bounces between elements on murals of opposite walls and the ceiling, we found that VR had affordances to show this thread, as well as annotate and label all of the historical figures in each of these paintings.
